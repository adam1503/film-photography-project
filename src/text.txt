DONE - to add a navbar which is displayed on each page
DONE- to add active buttons (dont know how to do it)

DONE - to be able to add just a photo of each in the liked section
DONE - delete all photos
DONE- delete individual photos
DONE - near the like, to show how many items are in the liked section
DONE - to have an about page (a photo with me and my zenit)

DONE - navbar


DONE- to add a like button to 'images' page
Done- once photo is liked, to display for 1-2 seconds : photo added to your list
DONE- if i move down, from one point to display an arrow that once cliked, will scroll the page up
DONE-react router: maintain scroll position


DONE - toggle the sidebar

DONE- in the single page, to have another right arrow and to use them to navigate through photos, despite just going back to home. 
DONE - also, in the single page, to have the like 

DONE- another idea: when i photo is liked, to display smth: for example to color the liked button and to let it displayed.

DONE- liked.length number to the sidebar liked page
DONE- to style the description in the single page

DONE-to see if the color of black blue will be ok for all the descriptions
-maybe to have an animation for when the detele button is clicked (images page)

- if website takes to much to load, to display for 2-5 sec a loading icon

- to think about a feedback form  - maybe to have it in the about section / or at the end of the photos / or another page and to have a link in the navbar
DONE- to make website media responsive for phone

DONE-sidebar: to add animation to the camera icon

DONE- to have the alert positioned % width.

NOT NEEDED-about page - to have quite a long description, but from one point to add the button 'read more' and once it is clicked, to display on the whole page the description (to have also a close button) - here i will have to use the "overflow"
- about page - to make the text clickable, and once it is clicked to display it bigger

DONE-single page - to move the buttons in the middle
-i dont think that every picture should have a description
